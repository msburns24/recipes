# Intro

Since college, I've always loved to cook. It's my belief that everyone deserves to eat good food without the expense of a restaurant. I made this website to showcase some of my favorite recipes in the hopes that you will find the same joy that I have.

# Project Skills

Along with showcasing recipes, I also sought to exercise some basic HTML skills, including:

- HTML Structure, along with `DOCTYPE` and `meta charset` elements.
- Basic HTML tags, including `<h1> - <h6>`, `<p>`, `<ul>, <ol>, & <li>`, `<img>`, and `<a>`.
