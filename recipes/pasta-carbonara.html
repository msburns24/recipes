  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    Pasta carbonara is one of those simple dinners we should 
    all know how to make. It's the perfect go-to for a busy 
    weeknight, and it's also a dish fit for the weekend or 
    even to serve to guests.
  </p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Prep Time:</strong> 15 mins</li>
    <li><strong>Cook Time:</strong> 20 mins</li>
    <li><strong>Total Time:</strong> 35 mins</li>
    <li><strong>Servings:</strong> 6</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>10 slices bacon, cut into 1/2 inch pieces</li>
    <li>8 1/2 cups water</li>
    <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 pound spaghetti or linguine</li>
    <li>
      1 1/4 cups finely grated parmesan cheese, 
      plus more for serving (2 oz)
    </li>
    <li>3 large eggs</li>
    <li>1 large egg yolk</li>
    <li>1 tsp each salt and pepper</li>
    <li>Chopped parsley, for garnish</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Add bacon and 1/2 cup of the water to a 
      large non-stick skillet and bring to a 
      simmer over medium-high heat.
    </li>
    <li>
      Allow to simmer until water evaporates 
      about 6 - 7 minutes, then reduce heat to 
      medium-low and continue to cook until bacon 
      is brown and crisp, about 6 - 8 minutes longer.
    </li>
    <li>
      Place a fine mesh strainer over a bowl then 
      pour bacon into strainer while reserving about 
      1 tsp of the rendered fat in pan. Return pan to 
      heat and saute garlic about 30 seconds, until 
      fragrant and lightly golden.
    </li>
    <li>
      Pour into a medium mixing bowl then add 1 Tbsp 
      rendered bacon fat (drippings in bowl set under 
      strainer) to mixing bowl with garlic. Add eggs, 
      egg yolk, parmesan and pepper to garlic mixture 
      and whisk until well combined.
    </li>
    <li>
      Meanwhile, bring 8 cups of water to a boil in a 
      large dutch oven (no more than 8 cups because 
      you want a very starchy water for the sauce). 
      Add spaghetti and salt to boiling water and cook 
      until al dente. While pasta is boiling, set a 
      colander in a large bowl.
    </li>
    <li>
      Carefully drain al dente pasta into colander in 
      bowl, while reserving pasta water in bowl. 
      Measure out 1 cup hot pasta water and discard 
      remaining water. Immediately place pasta in now 
      empty large bowl.
    </li>
    <li>
      Slowly pour and whisk 1/2 cup pasta water into 
      egg mixture, then slowly pour mixture over pasta 
      while tossing to coat. Add bacon and toss to 
      combine. Season with salt if desired.
    </li>
    <li>
      Let pasta rest, tossing frequently, 2 - 4 minutes 
      until sauce has thickened slightly and coats pasta. 
      Thin with remaining 1/2 cup hot pasta water as 
      needed. Serve immediately topped with additional 
      parmesan and parsley.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Notes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Use real Parmigiano Reggiano cheese for fresh 
      flavor and only freshly grated. It will melt better 
      and gives this dish a richer flavor. I like to use 
      a zest to grate it. Slightly pack when measuring or 
      use a kitchen scale.
    </li>
    <li>
      Be sure you immediately add the hot pasta water into 
      the egg mixture to help cook it (if needed, you 
      could even re-warm the water it in the microwave, 
      but it needs to be very hot).
    </li>
    <li>
      If you want a thicker sauce another option I have 
      tried is to toss the pasta with the sauce mixture in 
      a large heat proof bowl set over a pot of simmering 
      water, cooking for only about 1 minute or just until 
      thickened nicely. Careful not to overdue it or it can 
      be gluey.
    </li>
  </ul>
