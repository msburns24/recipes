    <li>1 large red bell pepper, thinly sliced</li>

    <li>2 tsp paprika</li>
    <li>1 tsp smoked paprika</li>
    <li>1/8 tsp allspice</li>
    <li>1/8 tsp ground cloves</li>
    <li>1/2 cup dry white wine</li>
    <li>1 cup chicken broth</li>
    <li>1 16 oz can crushed tomatoes</li>
    <li>1 6 oz can tomato paste</li>
    <li>2 bay leaves</li>
    <li>1 large carrot</li>
    <li>1 large stalk celery</li>
    <li>1 cup green olives</li>
    <li>1/2 cup roasted red peppers</li>
    <li>1/4 cup pimientos</li>
    <li>2 tbsp capers</li>
    <li>1/3 cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Pat the beef dry and sprinkle with salt and freshly 
      ground black pepper.
    </li>
    <li>
      Heat a little oil in a Dutch oven over high heat. Once 
      very hot add the beef and brown generously on all sides. 
      Transfer the beef to a plate. (Do not discard the 
      drippings and blackened bits in the pot, they are key 
      to the flavor.)
    </li>
    <li>
      Add the sliced vegetables to the pot and cook over medium 
      heat for 15-20 minutes until caramelized. Add the garlic 
      and spices and cook for another minute. Add the white 
      wine and bring it to a rapid boil, deglazing the bottom 
      of the pan (scraping up the browned bits on the bottom of 
      the pan).
    </li>
    <li>
      Add the broth, crushed tomatoes, tomato paste and bay 
      leaves. Simmer for 5 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Return the roast to the pot along with the pieces of 
      carrots and celery. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to 
      low, cover and simmer for 3-4 hours or until the beef is 
      fork tender and falls apart easily. Discard the celery, 
      carrots and bay leaves.
    </li>
    <li>
      Transfer the beef to a plate and shred it. Return the 
      shredded beef to the pot.
    </li>
    <li>
      Stir in the olives, roasted red peppers, capers and 
      pimientos. Simmer uncovered to thicken the sauce for 30 
      minutes. Stir in the parsley and add salt and pepper to 
      taste.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Notes</h2>
  <p>
    For a variation on traditional beef you can also use pork or 
    chicken (bone-in/skin-on for the most flavor or boneless 
    breast or thighs).
